### My Background and Interests

Background: Ideally, the Windows XP background, but fact of the matter is that I'm from Clarksville, TN and it's been that way for a long time (about 21 years if I remember right).

Interests: About .05%. Other than that I think cloud services are cool. Game development is pretty cool too, wouldn't wanna work professionally in the field though. I like front-end design a lil too.
